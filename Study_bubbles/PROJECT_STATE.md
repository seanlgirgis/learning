# PROJECT_STATE

Current active direction:
StudyBubble is single-file-only for current development.
Do not use multi-file output, local HTTP server testing, or fetch-based
topic loading as acceptance criteria unless the user explicitly reopens that
architecture later.
Deprecated implementation residue:
Some old non-active code paths may still exist from earlier multi-file work.
Do not treat them as active concerns or repeat them in normal reports unless
they cause a failing test or the user explicitly opens a cleanup task.
Active acceptance remains direct-open outputs/single_file/*.html.

- Project Name: study_bubbles
- Project Purpose: Build a small, static, reusable study bubble system that generates study maps from topic data files.
- Current Phase: v1.2 — Layout persistence (localStorage + import-layout + Import Layout UI)
- Completed: Toolbar search and data-driven group filters were added to the viewer; Iteration 11 regression fixes restored single-file topic loading and parent-topic double-click fallback navigation; Iteration 12 adds visible parent/back and child-topic navigation buttons while preserving double-click shortcuts; Iteration 13 adds a four-screen capacity forecasting case-study path and repairs dense-layout readability with improved sizing/spacing/label/link rendering; Iteration 14 adds a grandchild topic for three-level navigation proof.
- Outputs: Single-file outputs are the active acceptance artifacts (`outputs/single_file/*.html`); multi-file outputs are deprecated historical/debug artifacts.
- BOA Migration Status: No BOA migration or data extraction was performed.
- Review Artifact: `docs\BOA_REFERENCE_BEHAVIOR_REVIEW.md`
- Source/Output Rule: generated HTML is output, not source; generated outputs are disposable/rebuildable artifacts.
- BOA Status: Preserved safely as a reference prototype.
- Engine path (learning repo): `Study_bubbles/`
- Environment Bootstrap Command: From `study_bubbles`, run `..\env_setter.ps1`
- Relationship: ChatGPT StudyBubble is architect/orchestrator; Codex is implementor.
- Primary Acceptance Smoke Target: `outputs/single_file/python_overview.html` and `outputs/single_file/pandas.html`, opened directly from File Explorer.
- Manual Smoke Status: PASS (single-file browser smoke completed for `python_overview.html` -> `pandas.html` -> back to `python_overview.html`; visible child-topic button PASS; visible parent/back button PASS; double-click shortcut PASS; console clean; search/filters/sidebar/reset PASS).
- Iteration 13 Visual Smoke Status: First review FAILED (overlap/crowding/readability); repair implemented; rerun pending.
- Iteration 13 Visual Polish Status: Vertical centering adjusted to better use map area; browser smoke rerun PASS.
- Iteration 13 Manual Smoke Status: PASS (`case_capacity_overview`/`evidence`/`forecast`/`decision` direct-open screens; readable non-overlapping bubbles; clear size contrast; visible links; left/center/right flow; parent/child buttons and double-click shortcut PASS; search/filters/sidebar/reset PASS; console clean).
- Iteration 14 Navigation Status: Grandchild topic wired (`overview -> evidence -> feature_table -> evidence -> overview`) with topic-declared parent/back links; manual browser smoke pending.
- Multi-file Note: local HTTP server applies only to deprecated multi-file fetch testing and is not part of active acceptance.
- v0.7 BOA Parity Smoke Status: PASS (`case_capacity_overview.html` direct-open; search/filter/study paths clickable with path highlighting and reset clear; minimap/zoom/pan/fit/reset/drag/focus/context menu + context reset PASS; keyboard navigation PASS; parent/child/grandchild navigation PASS; console functionally clean for acceptance).
- Console Notes: `file://` unique origin warning observed and accepted for direct-open single-file use; `aria-hidden` focus warning observed after context-menu close and accepted as non-blocking accessibility polish.
- v0.9 Smoke Status: PASS (`case_capacity_feature_table.html` direct-open; enhanced study card fields render; local SVG preview from `outputs/single_file/assets/feature-table-example.svg`; search finds optional text; external link opens; parent/back returns to Evidence and Features; reset clears search; Copy Safe Sentence and Copy Study Card PASS; no TypeError/ReferenceError/SyntaxError/ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND).
- Product Direction Note: StudyBubble is primarily a visual study-map builder; copy buttons are secondary polish.
- v1.0 Release-Folder Smoke Status: PASS (`outputs/releases/studybubble-v1.0/index.html` direct-open; launch links render; overview/evidence/feature-table pages open from release folder; bubbles/controls render; image/diagram loads from release assets; no TypeError/ReferenceError/SyntaxError/ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND).
- v1.1 Resize Smoke Status: PASS (divider drag resizes panel; map adjusts; card text wraps; image scales; panel scrolls; minimap remains usable; width persists after refresh; no TypeError/ReferenceError/SyntaxError/ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND).
- Next Intended Step: proceed with next post-v1.1 usability priorities.
