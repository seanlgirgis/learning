```

## Purpose

This course introduces the theory and implementation patterns needed to build a basic generative AI application.

The package is organized around four learning layers:

```text
Theory
→ understand the concepts

Code patterns
→ remember how to implement them

Labs
→ verify behavior locally

RemNote
→ reinforce recall over time
```

## Course modules

1. **Generative AI, Prompt Engineering, and Prompt Templates**
   - generative versus discriminative AI
   - foundation models and LLMs
   - zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting
   - self-consistency
   - `PromptTemplate`
   - `ChatPromptTemplate`
   - `FewShotPromptTemplate`

2. **Introduction to LangChain in Generative AI Applications**
   - LangChain components
   - LCEL
   - runnables and automatic coercion
   - `RunnableParallel`
   - output parsers
   - provider-native structured output
   - message history and provider switching

3. **Build a Generative AI Application with LangChain**
   - model selection and evaluation
   - multimodel design
   - Flask routing
   - HTTP responses and validation
   - prototype-to-production concerns

## Local lab

Runnable examples are stored under:

```text
lab/python/
```

The lab covers:

- prompt templates;
- chat prompt templates;
- few-shot prompts;
- local and provider-backed LCEL pipelines;
- OpenAI and IBM watsonx provider switching;
- `RunnableParallel`;
- JSON parsing;
- Pydantic structured output;
- `MessagesPlaceholder`;
- manual and reusable conversation history.

lab/lab_run_book.md
lab/lab_guide.html
```

## Current status

```text
Platform: IN PROGRESS
Documentation: STRONG
Local lab: STRONG for Modules 1–2
Module 3: theory in study pages (model selection, Flask concepts) — no local Flask lab; not in RemNote decks
Recall: DEVELOPING
Interview readiness: NEEDS REPETITION
```

## Recommended study order

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Read `study_pages/field_guide.html`.
3. Study the three module guides in order.
4. Use `concept_and_code_quick_lookup.html` for fast recall.
5. Practice with `langchain_code_patterns.html`.
6. Run the examples from `lab/python/`.
7. Review the RemNote theory and coding decks.
8. Return to Coursera and complete the official lessons and labs.
9. Reconcile new Coursera evidence into the course package.

## Architecture rule

This folder is the single canonical home for the course.

Specialization, certificate, and track pages should link here using relative links. They should not maintain duplicate active copies of this course.
