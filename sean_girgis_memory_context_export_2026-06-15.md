## 2. Learning Style and Collaboration Preferences

### Teaching style

- Learns best through **very small, explicit, bite-sized steps**.
- Often prefers one concept or one action at a time.
- Does not want large lesson dumps.
- Responses for study sessions should usually stay well under one A4 page.
- Concepts may need to be revisited from more than one angle before they fully click.
- Hidden assumptions should be made explicit.
- Interactive learning is preferred:
  1. One small explanation
  2. One tiny task or question
  3. Wait for Sean’s response before continuing
- Sean has said that ADD affects how he learns and organizes information.

### Documentation preferences

- Theory and conceptual meaning should be central.
- Code should be explained clearly rather than merely listed.
- Preserve exact canonical filenames.
- Do not create unnecessary suffixes such as:
  - `_updated`
  - `_final`
  - `_new`
- Prefer relative links inside repositories.
- Prefer consolidated digests and reference guides.
- For major projects, maintain continuity documents such as:
  - `README.md`
  - `MEMORY.md`
  - `CURRENT_STATE.md`
  - `RUNBOOK.md`
  - `CAPABILITIES.md`
  - project constitutions
  - Codex task headers
- For Codex-ready work, Sean prefers exact:
  - paths
  - files to create or modify
  - responsibilities
  - validation commands
  - expected outputs
  - scope limits

### Development workflow preferences

- Sean commonly runs commands manually.
- He prefers implementation prompts that are directly usable by Codex.
- Reusable mechanics should be centralized in shared libraries instead of copied into multiple exercises.
- Production-quality library code should be:
  - documented
  - typed
  - tested
  - reusable
- Generalize first, test it, run an example, then replace duplicated local implementations.
- Keep special cases local only when they are genuinely not generalizable.

## 9. Coursera / IBM RAG for Generative AI Applications

### Organization

The Coursera specialization is organized inside the same unified root:

```text
D:\Workarea\StudyBook\study_maps\DataCamp
```

Naming:

- Coursera folders use the `crs_` prefix.

Specialization:

```text
crs_rag_for_generative_ai_applications
```

The specialization has four Coursera/IBM courses.

Workflow:

1. Coursera reconnaissance first
2. Capture the actual course concepts
3. Build tiny local Lego-style labs
4. Reuse the best mechanics in a central library
5. Expand toward complete RAG applications

Primary provider:

- OpenAI

Future provider:

- IBM watsonx
- Sean created a free IBM watsonx account and wants to incorporate it later

### Canonical course location

The canonical course belongs under:

```text
D:\Workarea\StudyBook\study_maps\DataCamp\courses\crs_develop_generative_ai_applications_get_started
```

The older location under the specialization course tree is legacy/noncanonical:

```text
D:\Workarea\StudyBook\study_maps\DataCamp\skill_tracks\crs_rag_for_generative_ai_applications\courses\develop_generative_ai_applications_get_started
```

### Documentation revamp preference

Sean requested a theory-centered rebuild in small review batches, beginning with:

```text
index.html
study_pages\field_guide.html
study_pages\chapter_01_ai_foundations_and_prompt_engineering_field_guide.html
```

The file list may evolve when useful new study documents become apparent.

- latency
- retries
- failures
- provider errors
- operational metrics

---

## 12. Python Environments and Local Development

### Preferred central environment root

```text
C:\py_venv
```

### Foundation environment

A Python 3.13.11 environment was created at:

```text
D:\py_venv\rag_application_builder_foundation
```

A navigation helper named `RagCode` was defined in:

```text
D:\py_venv\rag_application_builder_foundation\set_env.ps1
```

It changes directory to the foundation Python lab.

### Python versions mentioned

- Global Python:
  - 3.14.3
- Foundation virtual environment:
  - 3.13.11
- Other versions present under:

```text
C:\pyver
```

Including references to:

```text
py10
py119
py312
Python3114
```

### Environment preferences

- Centralize virtual environments.
- Centralize reusable libraries under:

```text
D:\py_libs
```

- Keep project labs separate from reusable libraries.
- Use `.env` files where appropriate.
- Do not commit secrets.

---

## 13. OpenAI Integration Learning System

After completing the current Developing AI Applications work, Sean wants to build a dedicated repository-based learning system for OpenAI integration.

The system should grow through:

1. tiny examples
2. reusable mechanics
3. Lego-style application components
4. larger applications
5. a personal shared Python library

The library should hide repetitive integration plumbing and make application development easier.

Desired reusable areas include:

- client configuration
- requests
- normalized responses
- structured output
- retries
- validation
- conversation handling
- RAG
- agent tools
- monitoring
- cost tracking
- budgets
- observability

---

## 14. RemNote Study System

Sean uses RemNote as the spaced-repetition system for review.

### General organization

- One RemNote space for IT learning is acceptable.
- Folders should provide rational structure.
- Permanent learning material remains in repositories and course chats.
- RemNote contains review cards organized by:
  - course
  - chapter
  - topic
  - technical knowledge
  - career/interview review
  - work/internal learning

Suggested hierarchy includes:

```text
IT Professional Development
├── Active Courses
├── Technical Knowledge
├── Career and Interview Review
└── Archive
```

Additional named areas include:

```text
Coursera
DataCamp
Sean’s Experience and Stories
LTIM Training
BOA Concepts
General Work Skills
```

### Preferred card strategy

- Multiple-choice cards are the primary learning mode.
- Multiple-choice should cover the full topic.
- A separate selective reinforcement mode should use mixed card types for:
  - confusing concepts
  - mistakes
  - code patterns
  - targeted review
- Do not force a fixed percentage for each card type.
- Let the study chat choose proportions according to the topic.

### File organization

Each RemNote chapter should contain a `Study` subfolder.

Numbered Markdown imports should make sequence obvious:

```text
01_...
02_...
03_...
```

Files must be:

- clean
- coherent
- limited to one topic or review unit
- free of junk noise
- tested for actual import behavior

At the end of a course, Sean wants the RemNote study-system constitution recreated by combining:

- the original project guide
- lessons learned from the course
- successful import formats
- card-generation practices

### Coding-card stack

For the current LangChain course, wait until code examples are complete.

Then create a dedicated numbered coding-terms/code-writing stack based on exact code patterns that successfully ran in Sean’s environment, including examples such as:

- `PromptTemplate.from_template()`
- `prompt.invoke()`
- `formatted.to_string()`
- `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages()`
- `MessagesPlaceholder()`
- LCEL pipes
- `RunnableLambda`
- `RunnableParallel`
- output parsers

---

## 15. Public and Portfolio Projects

### HorizonScale

A time-series forecasting engine that:

- processes more than 8,000 time series
- runs model tournaments
- uses Spark
- supports capacity forecasting
- is part of Sean’s public technical story

### AI-powered job-search pipeline

Uses:

- Grok
- RAG
- FAISS
- structured YAML career profile
- retrieval-grounded fit scoring
- duplicate detection

### Possible YouTube/content niche

Sean has considered a children’s-story content niche based on different cultures and historical settings, including:

- Arab stories
- Persian stories
- Sindbad-style stories
- exposure to different eras and cultures

Sean is skeptical of hype-heavy “easy AI side hustle” claims and wants realistic evaluation of monetization claims.

---

## 16. Git, Backup, and Repository Practices

- Sean uses Git across multiple repositories.
- A helper such as `gitqall.ps1` is used to sync repositories.
- Originals that should not be committed are Git-ignored.
- Sensitive or large originals may be backed up to encrypted storage.
- Repositories should include:
  - memory documents
  - state trackers
  - runbooks
  - clear indexes
  - relative links
  - validation instructions
- Avoid duplicate implementations and duplicate files.
- Preserve canonical paths and names.
- Do not reorganize established roots without explicit agreement.

OneDrive context:

- approximately 1 TB total storage
- approximately 538.8 GiB free was previously noted

---

## 17. Logging and Observability Coding Interests

Sean has practiced or planned structured logging patterns involving:

- structured log files
- JSON logging
- development versus production logging
- `structlog`
- bound loggers
- context variables
- pipeline-stage logging
- extract → transform → load tracing
- DataFrame operation tracing
- error diagnosis

Example paths referenced in prior work included:

```text
LOG_DIR/02_structured.log
LOG_DIR/03_structlog_prod.json
```

Observability is both:

- a career strength
- a design requirement for future AI systems

---

## 18. Known Debugging Example

A prior SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL error involved:

```text
ProgrammingError: column t.sample_time does not exist
```

The query joined:

- `telemetry_samples`
- `services`
- `hosts`

The database hint suggested that `t.sample_id` may have been intended.

The query attempted to order by:

```text
t.sample_time
s.service_name
h.host_name
```

This reflects Sean’s broader work with telemetry and observability datasets.

---

## 19. Current Focus Priorities

Current direction, in practical order:

1. Continue developing AI application skills.
2. Complete and organize the Coursera IBM RAG specialization.
3. Keep DataCamp materials consolidated and certification-ready.
4. Build the RAG Application Builder Foundation.
5. Expand the reusable `rag_foundation` library.
6. Add observability, token, cost, and budget tracking.
7. Build toward production-style RAG and agent applications.
8. Maintain employability in Python, PySpark, AWS, ETL, data engineering, and observability.
9. Preserve BOA/LTIM learning safely in the private ALOK second brain.
10. Use RemNote for structured long-term review.

---

## 20. Important Standing Constraints

- Teach in small bites.
- Do not assume hidden steps were understood.
- Avoid large study dumps.
- Preserve exact paths and canonical filenames.
- Do not create unnecessary duplicate files.
- Do not move established roots without agreement.
- Use a shared library for reusable mechanics.
- Keep future library code production-quality.
- Do not commit secrets or sensitive work information.
- Keep BOA/LTIM materials sanitized.
- Use multiple-choice as the primary RemNote learning mode.
- Use numbered import filenames inside chapter-level `Study` folders.
- Make study documents theory-centered and explain code clearly.
- Build Coursera content from actual course reconnaissance rather than inventing a parallel curriculum.
- Prefer OpenAI as the primary provider while leaving room for IBM watsonx.
- Include monitoring and budget visibility in the AI application architecture.
- Sean runs commands manually and benefits from exact Codex-ready prompts.

---

- medicine identification
- seafood restaurants

## 23. Suggested Use of This File

This file can serve as:

- a continuity handoff for a new ChatGPT project chat
- a personal project-context backup
- a source for project-specific constitutions
- a checklist for correcting outdated memories
- a starting point for deciding what should be remembered or forgotten

When using it in a new chat, it is best to say:

> Treat this as background context. Ask me to confirm anything time-sensitive, and do not assume every path or project status is still current.

## 24. Correction and Deletion Process

Sean can request any of the following:

- “Forget this item.”
- “Correct this path.”
- “This project is finished.”
- “Replace this memory with the following.”
- “Do not use this information in future conversations.”
- “Keep this only inside this project.”

Those requests should be applied explicitly rather than silently inferred.
